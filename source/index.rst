Welcome to Vivint Technician Help!
==================================

Welcome!

I've set this up to provide a collection of all the reference information
that I though would be useful in my job as a Vivint Field Technician.
Maybe it will be of use to you too.

You can find the read through :doc:`Table of Contents </contents>`; that
might be a good place to start looking. Alternately, try the :ref:`search`.

To see what's new, check out the :doc:`Changelog </changelog>`.

If I've missed something, please feel free to contribute the information.
If you've comformatable, you can submit a
`pull request on Github <https://github.com/MinchinWeb/vivint/compare>`_
or email me the information at
`william.minchin@vivint.com <mailto:william.minchin@vivint.com>`_.
